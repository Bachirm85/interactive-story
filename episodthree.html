                  <p style="color: black;">Caldwell and fellow climbers Beth Rodden, 
                    John Dickey and Jason Smith were held hostage for six days by rebels in Kyrgyzstan in August 2000. 
                    During the captivity, they run off food, no clothes to warm up, they were freezing to death. 
                    Caldwell had to take a tough decision, he pushed a lone captor, 
                    Ravshan Sharipov off a cliff in order to escape. On the 6th day the military of Kyrgyzstan 
                    found them and they went back home. 
                    They later heard that Sharipov survived the fall</p>
